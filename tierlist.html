    <h1>Best to Worst Mini trucks</h1>
    <h2>Out of the late 80s to early 90s options</h2>

        <li>Mazda B-series</li>
            <p>Yes, I am biased. They have by far the best extended cab, and even
                though they have the weakest engines (2.0 fe/2.2 f2/ 2.6 g6), the 
                f family of engines came in 12 valve turbo variants in the 626/probe GTs.
                my favorite styling, amazing build quality, reasonable prices, and tons of aftermarket
            </p>

                Great styling, and all of the provisions to swap in a 4g63. Less aftermarket
                than most of the other options, but the grille on these mini's single handly 
                carries it to 2nd place.

                I just like these a lot. My roomate has one and its always breaking,
                but we get it back running easily. Bonus points for the joe izusu ads

                Out of all of the japanese made mini trucks, I think these aged the worst.
                They are on the more expensive side of things, and I dont fit very well
                in the cab. The saving grace is of course the engine, a KA24e. AKA, the 
                240sx engine (techincally thats a KA24de, but close enough). Which makes 
                for the most powerful 4 cillinder engine but in a mini truck from this time.

            <p>
                Cheaply made and ugly as hell, buuuttttt... a 4.3 v6 with a 5 speed
                in a single cab s10 is the most power per pound you can get in a mini truck stock.
                Burnouts for days.

                Yeah yeah toyota reliability. They look good, the 22re in them is iconic,
                and it was in back to the future. Why is it down this far? Two words, Toyota Tax.
                A 270,000 B-series with a blown engine but straight body is 500$. The same condition
                Toyota is 5k. (only a slight exaguration)

                They are everywhere, just driving till they fall apart. Extended cabs
                are hideous in my opinion, but they are the absolute cheapest entry point.
                supply and demand I guess

                Is this a mini truck? Kinda. I was convinced to add this to the list,
                but im not placing it highly out of spite.

                These are not mini trucks. I hate these, genuinely. They look like a drunk
                man designed them with a ruler and couldnt keep his pen straight. This 
                one is on the list purely so I can hate on it.
