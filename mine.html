    <h1>My '91 B series</h1>
    <p>This is my B series, it is the second mini truck ive owned, and by far 
        my favorite vehicle i've owned ( I'm a habitual facebook marketplace flipper).
        I have completely rebuilt the top half of the engine, added a weber dgev carb,
        long tube headers, and a 2.5 exhaust with a flowmaster 40 series. Suspension
        wise it is lowered 4 inches at the current moment (I am constantly lowering it more
        and more), with beltech front and rear sway bars added. All this work makes for
        a wicked fun 70 hp ripper. Interior wise Ive sourced OEM buckets, and pieced together
        a full sound system with a 500w 10" sub, 2 100w 6" speakers, and 2 50w 4"s. The 
        wheels are from  a 2019 Tacoma trd. Front end wise I've added 7 inch halos from a 
        jeep by drilling and cutting away the grille until they fit, and added a chrome 
        bumper bar. It is loud, slow, low, and stupid as hell, just as a minitruck should be
